/**
 * Firebase **client** SDK (browser). Used by the login/register UI and the auth
 * context — **Auth only**. Firestore is never accessed from the browser (all
 * user reads/writes go through server routes backed by firebase-admin), so the
 * `firebase/firestore` SDK is intentionally NOT imported here: pulling it in
 * would drag ~90 kB of dead Firestore code into every auth/dashboard client
 * chunk. Only the public `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` config is needed — these values are
 * safe to ship to the client (access is governed by Firestore security rules,
 * not by hiding the apiKey).
 *
 * The values are hardcoded as fallbacks because they are public and identical
 * across every environment, and because they must be present at BUILD time
 * (NEXT_PUBLIC_* are inlined, and the auth pages prerender `getAuth()` — a
 * missing key crashes the build with auth/invalid-api-key). An env var, if set,
 * still wins, so a different Firebase project can be used without code changes.
